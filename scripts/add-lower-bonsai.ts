Moderate yellow exposure increases attentional engagement. Warm spectrum tones stimulate mental readiness more than cool hues (Elliot & Maier, 2014). Yellow wavelengths (~570–590 nm) are highly visible and naturally attention-directing, which makes them effective for signaling clarity and action.

    specificDescription: "The Sacral Chakra Aarohma Ekam Bonsai represents fluidity, creative spark, and the rhythmic pulse of life. Designed around the Svadhisthana’s symbolic language, this piece centers on the element of Water. While vibrant orange reflects the heat of passion and reproductive energy, the deep blue hues pay homage to the secondary associations- the cooling depths of the subconscious and the preservation of life. The form features an upward-reaching spiral that mimics a rising tide, illustrating that true creativity requires both movement and emotional depth. The connection to the Moon is central to this piece. Just as the moon’s gravitational pull dictates the Earth's tides, it governs the \"internal oceans\" of humans, who are composed of 80% water. This celestial influence ties directly to the sacral energy of menstruation, fertility, and birth, marking the sacred cycles that allow life to flow forward. The Adenium bonsai serves as a living metaphor for this chakra; its thick, succulent caudex is designed specifically to store water, embodying the ability to retain emotional wisdom while thriving in a state of constant, fluid growth. Suspended yarn elements and a crescent moon charm introduce a sense of weightlessness, reminding us that the sacral energy is most powerful when it is allowed to sway and adapt. Ideal for creative studios, bedrooms, or personal sanctuaries where you seek to unlock passion, embrace sensuality, and reconnect with your natural rhythm.",

Human bodies are composed of approximately 60% water (not 80%). There is no conclusive scientific evidence that lunar cycles directly influence human fluid systems in a measurable physiological tidal way. However: Humans are deeply responsive to cyclical patterns — circadian rhythms (sun-based) and monthly hormonal cycles are biologically real regulatory systems. The moon here symbolizes rhythm and cycle — not gravitational control over the body. Symbolic rhythm. Not literal tide mechanics."
