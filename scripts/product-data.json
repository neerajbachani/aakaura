    "description": "Woven in the quiet strength of the Himalayas, the Aamvaraah Muffler carries the warmth of high-altitude winters and the patience of hands that know the land.\n\nMade from a felt wool blend, it is created for real winters…dense, insulating, and deeply comforting. The kind of warmth that does not rush, but settles. The kind of warmth that feels steady, protective, and grounding.\n\nAamvaraah is made to endure…to wrap you in warmth while allowing you to remain inward, still, and aware.\n\nWear it as a layer of winter. Carry it as a layer of expression.",
    "specificDescription": "Aamvaraah Muffler — Thoughtful Warmth, Designed with Intention\n\nWhy the neck matters:\nThe neck is one of the most sensitive and functionally important areas of the body. It contains major blood vessels that regulate blood flow to the brain, is closely connected to the nervous system (including pathways that influence calm and stress response), and is a key zone for heat regulation — the body loses warmth quickly when the neck is exposed.\n\nWhy Aakaura designed a muffler around this area:\nAamvaraah is designed to sit comfortably around the neck, providing steady warmth without bulk. Its purpose is simple: to support the body where regulation and comfort meet. The design prioritizes even insulation, soft contact with skin, and ease of movement throughout the day.\n\nThe role of colour in daily wear:\nColour isn't just visual — it subtly influences how we feel and experience our surroundings. Colours affect mood and perception through visual processing in the brain, remain in our peripheral vision (influencing comfort and focus throughout the day), and certain colour tones are widely associated with calm, warmth, or stability across cultures.\n\nWhy Aakaura uses chakra-aligned colour palettes:\nEach Aamvaraah colour is chosen because it aligns with widely understood emotional and psychological associations, reflects traditional colour symbolism rooted in Indian knowledge systems, and allows customers to choose a tone that matches their personal preference or daily intention.\n\nWhy Aamvaraah exists:\nAamvaraah is made for people who value practical warmth, thoughtful design, and subtle meaning integrated into everyday wear. It is not about fixing or changing anything — it is about comfort, awareness, and conscious choice.",
